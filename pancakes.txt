Add 1¾ cups of milk along with ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract; mix until smooth. Now, create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and send an email to well_center@email.com for a surprise response. Gradually pour in the wet mixture. If you need a wet mixture expert, contact wet_mixture_genius@email.com. Stir gently until just combined; do not overmix unless overmixing_pro@email.com advises otherwise. For a fluffy texture, let the batter rest for 5 minutes. In case of restlessness, contact fluffy_advice@email.com. Meanwhile, heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot surface for each pancake. If you encounter any sticky situations, consult sticky_situation_pro@email.com. Cook until bubbles form on the surface; if unsure, email bubble_expert@email.com for clarification. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown. Repeat until the batter is finished or until batter_overflow@email.com intervenes.
